            <h4>Our Contract </h4><br />
            All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order
            price. Dispatch times may vary according to availability and subject
            to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for
            which we will not be responsible. In order to contract with Happy
            Pizza you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or
            debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us. Happy Pizza retains
            the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is
            accepted we will inform you by email and, SMS or via the website.
            When placing an order, you undertake that all details you provide to
            us are true and accurate, that you are an authorised user of the
            credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are
            sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail
            and/or webpage confirming receipt of your order: this email and or
            webpage will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute
            acceptance of your order. A contract between us will not be formed
            until we send you confirmation by the medium used for placing the
            order (SMS, e-mail or other appropriate digital means) that the
            goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only those
            goods listed sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the
            contract formed.

            <h4>Pricing and Availability</h4>
            <br />
            Whilst we try to ensure that all details, descriptions and prices
            which appear on this Website/Application are accurate, errors may
            occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you
            have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible and give
            you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or
            cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the
            order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the
            goods, you will receive a full refund. Delivery costs will be
            charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed
            where applicable and included in the 'Total Cost'.

            <h4>Payment</h4>
            <br />
            All online card payments are made to Optomany LTD. Payments made to
            Optomany LTD will appear on your statement as 'Optomany'. Upon
            receiving your order, we carry out a standard authorisation check on
            your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds to fulfil the
            transaction. Your card will be debited upon authorisation being
            received. The monies received upon the debiting of your card shall
            be treated as a full payment against the value of the goods you wish
            to purchase. Once the goods have been despatched and you have been
            sent a confirmation email, SMS or notification on the website, the
            monies paid shall be used for the value of goods you have purchased
            as listed.
